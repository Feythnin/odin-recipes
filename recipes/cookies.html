        <h1>The Best Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

        <p>A gooey chocolate chip cookie recipe is a delightful treat for any occasion. These cookies are characterized by their soft and chewy centers, packed with rich, melty chocolate chips. To achieve the perfect gooey texture, use a combination of brown and white sugars, which adds moisture and enhances flavor. Adding a touch of cornstarch can help create a soft, tender crumb. Be sure to slightly underbake the cookies, allowing them to firm up on the baking sheet as they cool. Enjoy them warm for an irresistible, melt-in-your-mouth experience.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li><b>Mix Wet Ingredients:</b> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><b>Combine Dry Ingredients:</b> In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
            <li><b>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</b> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the dough.</li>
            <li><b>Add Chocolate Chips:</b> Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li><b>Portion the Dough:</b> Use a cookie scoop or spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li><b>Bake:</b> Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers still look slightly underbaked.</li>
            <li><b>Cool:</b> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. This helps them set and maintain their gooey texture.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Makes roughly 24 cookies</strong></p>
